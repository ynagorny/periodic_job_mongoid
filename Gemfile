# Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax. Rake has the following features: * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?) * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites. * Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks. * Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths. * Supports parallel execution of tasks.
